# To Do App

## Author: Emily Greason

### Tech Requirements Lab 31

- Implement the React context API for defining settings across the entire application.
  - Create React Context for managing application display settings and provide this at the application level.
  - Add the following defaults to the context provider’s state, they will not be changeable in this lab.
    - Display three items.
    - Hide completed items using a boolean.
    - Define “difficulty” as a default sort word to optionally use in the stretch goal.
- Consume and utilize context values throughout your components.
  - Show a maximum of three items per screen by default in the <List /> component.
  - Use the Mantine (or MUI) <Pagination /> component to allow users to navigate a list of items.
  - Hide completed items in the list by default (the ability to show will be added in a later lab)

### Tech Requirements Lab 32

- Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components.
  - How many To Do Items to show at once.
  - Whether or not to show completed items.
  - Hint: if reusing the custom useForm() hook, event validation may be necessary if using any Mantine component other than <TextInput />.
- Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings.
  - This should be given in the form of a new component, perhaps linked to from the main navigation.
  - Hint: Use Browser Router to create the page/route/component for this.
  - Once settings are updated, render the updated settings to the right of the “form”. Consider using <Grid />, <Card />, and <When /> components.
- Save the users choices in Local Storage.
- Retrieve their preferences from Local Storage and apply them to the application on startup.

### Tech Requirements Lab 33

- Implement a Login/Auth React Context, “protect” the To Do application by restricting access to the various application features based on the users’ login status and capabilities.
  - Define a function that can simulate a login event.
    - Parameters: username and password as strings.
    - Sets a User on the auth context, and changes login status to true.
  - Define a function that can simulate a logout event.
    - Resets the User object and changes login status to `false.
  - Define a function that can authorize a User based on a capability.
    - Parameters: a capability as a string.
    - Returns a boolean whether the user has the capability parameter.
- Create an <Auth /> component with the following features:
  - Given a capability prop of type string, conditionally render components based on the user stored in context.
  - Hide the entire interface until the user has logged in.
  - Implements the following RBAC rules:
    - Logged In Users with ‘update’ permissions can click the records to mark them as complete.
    - Logged In Users with ‘create’ permissions can create new items.
    - Logged In Users with ‘delete’ permissions can delete items.
    - Logged In Users with ‘read’ permissions can see the list of To Do Items.
- Implement a <Login /> Component that has the following features:
  - Provide an account login screen with a form.
    - Accepts Username and Password.
    - On successful login, store the token as a cookie.
  - If a user returns and has a valid login cookie, hide the login form and consider them “Logged In”.
    - Display a logout button instead of a form if they are “Logged In”.

### Tech Requirements Lab 34

- Alter the Add, Toggle Complete, and Delete functions within your to do application to use your API instead of in memory state.
  - Fetch the current list of items from the database on application start.
  - Whenever you add/update/delete an item, refresh the state so the user can instantly see the change.
    - Consider: Do you re-fetch from the server every time you make a change?
      - If so, how?
      - If not, how will you stay in sync?
- Alter the Login Context to use the server to login users instead of our mock users list.
  - Be sure to store the token in state as well as in a cookie so you can reference it later.
- You will need deployed API Server, which implements a todo item data model.
  - GET /todo: Gets a list of all items.
  - ‘POST /todo’: Adds an item.
  - ‘PUT /todo’: Updates an item (you’ll use this to mark them as complete).
  - ‘DELETE /todo/:id’ : Deletes an item.
- You will need a deployed Authenticated API Server, which supports:
  - Registration (/signup).
  - Login (/signin).
  - Authorization (via Bearer Token).
  - ACL (using user roles).
    - Make sure you have created the user roles and permissions lists that your front-end is expecting to tap into.
  - To Do data model for storing the actual to do items.
